### Art Piece 2
![Martin Wattenberg](ColorCode.png?raw=true "Martin Wattenberg")

“Color Code” by Martin Wattenberg depicts more than 33,000 English nouns as the color that is the average color of images found by searching the word in a search engine, specifically the first 50 image results from a Yahoo image search. They are then grouped by meaning so that like words, like the names of flowers or dances are near each other. The piece is interactive, and viewers can explore it in different ways, such as selecting a color and seeing which words correspond or searching words for their color and their section. I was drawn to this because at first it looks like a pixelated beige rectangle, but with a closer look it’s fascinating to see what colors our search algorithms have unintentionally assigned to our words, for me especially the very slight differences in some words I would assume would be exactly the same, such as types of pasta.
